# Gradient Descent Exporation
Use of GD algorithm for function optimization and linear regression.  

This notebook shows how GD converges to a solution in the cases of both a generic function in R^3 as well as the linear regression problem for a somewhat random dataset.  The regression model generated from this custom GD algorithm is also compared with the tried and tested regression model from Scikit-learn, which uses the inverse of a matrix method for its regression.
